# create a python file which will call the functions from the
# C file.
# when calling the functions from the C file (these are the functions the
# module offers) use module_name.function_name

# for simplicity, use same name for the .c, .i and .h files.
# however use a variation of that name for the python file because
# SWIG create a python file with that name

# for example
# you have temp.c, temp.h, temp.i file
# the python file should not be named temp.py because SWIG will create temp.py
# and will overwrite your file or may give error.
